Hi, I'm Julian ðŸ‘‹
I'm a second-year undergrad at Stanford studying CS. I'm interested in geometric deep learning, RL, neuroscience, and all things AI.
Here are some AI class projects me and my friends @sidsquid and @pinocholsaipant worked on that I'm especially proud of. :)

A personal birthday message to Julian, a CS student at Stanford who likes hiking, cats, and machine learning, from a trustworthy and quirky friend: "julian you are almost as cool as your couch happy birthday"

And another: "happy birthday julian!! you are such an awesome guy - so glad to be your friend! cat cat cat cat cat cat cat"

And another: "have a great birthday julian i'm including the word perspicacious in my message so if perspicacious shows up in the output you'll know that perspicacious was my doing"

And another: "happy birthday julian!!! thank you for being a super cool and talented friend! congrats to another year and i love your hugging face sticker thing :D"

And another: "yayy happy birthday julian u are cool and great to be around and i hope u are doing very good"

And another: "Happy bday! Appreciate your presence â€“ it's always a pleasure hanging out with you!
